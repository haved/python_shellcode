# Python shellcode

This repository contains my attempts at running C in python for extra speed,
in a setting where one is only allowed to submit a single python file.

I am running Linux, and the target server is as well.
I have no idea how this would be on Windows, but you probably don't get `mmap` from `libc`.

I have done this 3 times:
 - `poolPrism/` is a O(n‚Å¥) algorithm on a two-dimensional array, passed to C via `array.array`.
 - `queue/` is a queue implementaton, special because it hacks into python built-ins to avoid ctypes overhead.
 - `ahoCorasick/` counts occurances of several needles in a haystack string. Does recursion in C, so uses linking.

## Running machine code in Python
This is accomplished through allocating a block of memory using `mmap`,
accessed through the python library `ctypes`.
```python
libc = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(None) # Gives libc
mmap_function = libc.mmap
mmap_function.restype = ctypes.c_void_p
mmap_function.argtypes = (ctypes.c_void_p, ctypes.c_size_t,
                          ctypes.c_int, ctypes.c_int,
                          ctypes.c_int, ctypes.c_size_t)
CODE_SIZE = 1000
code_address = mmap_function(None, CODE_SIZE,
                             mmap.PROT_READ | mmap.PROT_WRITE | mmap.PROT_EXEC,
                             mmap.MAP_PRIVATE | mmap.MAP_ANONYMOUS,
                             -1, 0)
if code_address == -1:
    raise OSError('mmap failed to allocate memory')
```

The memory is marked as both writeable and executable,
so we can copy whatever bytes we feel like to the block.
If the block happens to contain machinecode, we can cast the address of the machinecode
into a ctypes function pointer with the correct signature, and call the function.

## Compiling C to machine code
In this case, the block of machinecode comes from a C-program with the following function:
```c
int cuboid(int n, int* heights, int* data) {
   ...
```

The c program `pool.c` has been compiled using
```
gcc -O3 -c pool.c -o pool.o
```
This creates an object file containing machine code for the function, but it will not be linked with anything.
This means function calls don't work from one function to another,
and standard libraries / Python libraries are not accessible.
You can probably hack around this, but I recommend using macros for most things.

EDIT: Linking is actually not that bad, just remove `-c` from the command, and add an empty `main()` function.
This doesn't give you access to libc as far as I can see, but at least you can call your own functions.
When exporting the text section, note that it starts at `0x1020` or someting,
so remove that from the offset provided by `objdump`. See Aho-Corasick.

EDIT: Sometimes `-O3` is a bit too eager to unroll loops, and degrades performance.
`-O2` at least never seems to be worse than no optimization.

You can not use global variables either, but local variables work fine.
Keep in mind that string literals might be lost when copying the `.text` section.
My general tip is to pass a common data pointer as a parameter to every function,
or use pointers in your data structures. See my Aho-Corasick.

## Exporting machine code to python
After compiling, check at what offsets of `.text` your function(s) start at.
```
objdump -d -M intel pool.o
```

Now dump the text section into it's own file `text.o` (without ELF headers or anything, just pure machinecode)
```
objcopy --only-section=.text -O binary pool.o text.o
```

Finally use some python to turn the binary file (`text.o`) into a python byte literal (`text.py`).
```python
with open("text.o", "rb") as fil:
    with open("text.py", "w") as ut:
        ut.write(str(fil.read()))
```

Now this block of machinecode bytes can be copied into our mmapped block,
and the address of the function *inside* the block can be casted to a ctypes function pointer.

```python
code=b'<machine code here>'
assert len(code) <= CODE_SIZE
ctypes.memmove(code_address, code, len(code))

cuboid_function_type = ctypes.CFUNCTYPE(ctypes.c_int, ctypes.c_int, ctypes.c_void_p, ctypes.c_void_p)
cuboid_function = ctypes.cast(code_address+0x00, cuboid_function_type)
```

Now we can call `cuboid_function` as a regular python function that takes three numbers, and returns an int.
`ctypes` will handle converting python types to C values of correct size.

## Allocating working memory
Our call to mmap takes a size, but is not guarranteed to be of that size.
If you need a big block of working memory, I suggest using
```
data_address = ctypes.cast(ctypes.create_string_buffer(DATA_SIZE), ctypes.c_void_p)
```
This will allocate a buffer of size `DATA_SIZE` bytes, and cast it to a void pointer.
This value can now be passed to any function that takes a `int* data`, or whatever other
pointer type you want.

If you need to clear the memory between different runs of your c-function,
I found it easiest to do it from python:
```
ctypes.memset(data_address, 0, DATA_SIZE)
```

## Passing arrays from python to C
The way I did this was by creating an `array.array('i')`, and appending all the needed data.
To pass it to a C function I simply get the address and pass it as a void pointer. (recieved as an `int*`).
```
array_address, _ = heights.buffer_info()
```

You can also pass byte arrays to c simply by passing them. Great if you want to send a string.
On the c side you simply recieve a `char*`. I assume ctypes does something behind the scenes to make it work,
so you should probably be specific when you describe the function's signature, e.g. `ctypes.c_char_p` works.
```
dna_buf = dna.encode('utf-8')

return string_match_c(dna_buf, ...)

```

## Removing ctypes overhead
ctypes does conversions and stuff, which makes it kind of slow.
If you're calling the ctypes function once or twice that's fine,
but if you want to call it 1000 times it might not even be faster than writing
your solution in python.

My trick for this is using ctypes a constant number of times to change the internal function pointers of
some arbitrary python builtins, and then calling those. This is however much harder,
since one must compile with the correct version of the `Python.h` header to access internal fields,
and you can not use function calls, only macros (and static (?)). You need to work with `PyObject*`
everywhere since that's the signatures of the internal python functions you impersonate.
This also means reference counting counts on you to increase references of stuff.

To see this, go to the [queue readme](queue/readme.md).
